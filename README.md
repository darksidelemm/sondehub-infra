# SondeHub

Sondehub aggregates telemetry data that is uploaded from community run radiosonde receiver stations (currently only [radiosonde_auto_rx](https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx/wiki) though others are welcome to contribute!). Weather balloons are launched from numerous weather organisations around the world, with the data used to build weather models such as the [GFS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs) and [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/). The goal of SondeHub is collect the community-sourced data in a central location to allow organisations to develop their own models and forecasting, and to assist hobbyists in the recovery of the radiosondes themselves (which are otherwise discarded).

Sondehub is based around Amazon-Web-Services (AWS), and this repository serves as a place to configure the various configuration scripts and lambdas (Python scripts) that are used to keep Sondehub running. The wiki section of this repository is currently serving as a temporary API reference, until a better solution is set up.
